I am a software engineer working as an Android developer. I love Kotlin ðŸ’œ.

- You may explore my Android-related projects, [Compose Navigation extensions](https://github.com/hrach/navigation-compose-ext), or [Orbit Compose](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit-compose) â€“ Orbit design system implementation in Jetpack Compose.
- I develop [@nextras](https://github.com/nextras) packages â€“ a set of PHP libraries for database stuff: [Orm](https://github.com/nextras/orm) and related [PHPStan extension](https://github.com/nextras/orm-phpstan/), [PhpStorm plug-in](https://github.com/nextras/orm-intellij) and [Dbal](https://github.com/nextras/dbal). Nextras components aim to provide excellent support for database access in PHP. 

If you like what I do, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/hrach). In my free time, I develop and maintain open-source libraries. By supporting my work, you will endorse further development and maintenance. Thank you!
