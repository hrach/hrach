I am a software engineer currently working as an Android developer in [@kiwicom](https://guthub.com/kiwicom/). You can take a look at [Orbit Compose](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit-comse) - Orbit design system implementation in JetPack Compose. Btw, I love Kotlin – the best programming language ever.

I develop [@nextras](https://github.com/nextras) packages – a set of PHP libraries for database stuff: [Orm](https://github.com/nextras/orm) and related [PHPStan extension](https://github.com/nextras/orm-phpstan/) and [PhpStorm plug-in](https://github.com/nextras/orm-intellij) and [Dbal](https://github.com/nextras/dbal). Nextras components aim to provide excellent support for database access in PHP. 

You can ❤️ [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/hrach) if you like what I do! I develop and maintain open source in my free time. By supporting my work you will endorse further development and maintenance.
